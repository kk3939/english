My favorite band is AC/DC. Their songs are so fascinating to me.


Do you know Dream Theater? They are a band.

Yeah, 'Breaking All Illusions' is the best for me. It's better than their other songs.

It's so complex. There are many instruments like the guitar, synthesizer, drums, and so on. The harmony of them is so great.
