And if I make any mistakes with vocabulary and grammar, please point them out so I can improve my English skills.

I would like to share about my journey last February.


I went to Shimane Prefecture in Japan, which has many temples. Sorry, I've forgotten the names of some of them.

Yeah, of course. I went to some temples and shrines, ate some local food, and visited very expensive hotels.


Shimane beef was very good to me. It was so delicious, better than the beef I usually eat.

Yeah, the hotel is famous. I found it on Instagram.

Yes, the hotel exceeded my expectations. It was so beautiful, especially the view.

Yeah, my favorite part was the view and the food. It was so delicious and memorable.

Actually, I'm not good at taking photos, so I went to the hotel with my girlfriend and she took most of the photos.
