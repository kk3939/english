Yes, I like reading books and, however, I don't have read books recently, but especially I like books written by Murakami Haruki.

Yeah, I can't quite express it, but the story is fascinating, and the characters are very nice. I mean the characters in the novel.

Actually, I read this book five years ago, so I've forgotten the names of the characters. But I would like to ask you, who are the characters?

Yeah, the main character is Toru. Toru Watanabe is very memorable for me. I just remembered.
