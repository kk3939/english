I would like to talk about how to spend time on the weekend.

those kinds of tasks.

Now, I play just for fun. Before, when I was in high school, I played in a band.

I prefer playing songs in a band more than solos.

Sorry to interrupt, Could you please point out any mistakes I might have made in our past conversations?
