### 10. スポーツ
好きなスポーツや最近の試合について話す。

My favorite sport is volleyball. I played volleyball for about eight years during junior high school and high school.

The most enjoyable part of volleyball is that we cannot touch the ball twice in a row.

Because we have to collaborate with our teammates. For example, in soccer, we can touch the ball twice or more, so we can play by ourselves. On the other hand, in volleyball, we need to collaborate with our teammates. We have to talk about the current situation, how to win, and what strategy to focus on. So, we need to be more cooperative.

Yes, there is a position called the setter, who is the game maker. They create a great strategy. They need to make a good strategy to win the game.

There are three points. First, observing our teammates and the opposing team members. Second, predicting the next situation and circumstance. Third, calculating the percentage of winning.

Actually, it is quite difficult to develop that skill later in life. I believe it is something innate.

### 11. ペット

About 30 minutes. Generally, it is said that walking for 30 minutes every day is very useful for your health. It's very healthy.

Yes, I find it very relaxing.


### 16. 未来の計画

In the future, I would like to achieve making a great business to change the world.

What area? I'm Japanese, so if I start a business, I'll do it in Japan.

In Japan, labor problems are very important because the population is decreasing. It is a social problem, and I would like to solve the related issues.

First, I would like to visit Turkey and Europe, because I admire that area.

Cappadocia is famous in Japan and is considered a World Heritage site.

Well, how can I describe it? The balloon and the basket, we can go up and down. I'd like to ride one.

At least once.→一回でも

I get drunk easily.
I have a low tolerance.

### 18. 友人関係
親しい友人とのエピソードや友情の大切さについて話す。

First of all, I rarely make new friends. If the environment changes, I do make some new friends.

Secondly, I value how relaxing it is to stay with a friend. Normally, I'm busy because there are many tasks, so I would like to spend relaxing time with a friend at least.

Thirdly, spending daily time with my friend is the most memorable time.


It is difficult to make new friends because we have to share our backgrounds and concepts with each other. It takes a lot of time and effort.

I usually play games and listen to music.

Yes, I have. When I lost my friend's card, I had a conflict with him. It was all my fault, so I apologized deeply.


### 19. ボランティア活動
自分が関わったボランティア活動やその経験について話す。

Actually, I have never participated in any volunteer activities.

In America, most high school students need to participate in volunteer activities to enter universities.

However, in Japan, we can pass the entrance exam without them.

That's why I am not familiar with them.

I have never composed my own songs. Knowing music theory is essential for doing that, I think.

### 22. 好きな場所
よく行く場所や特に好きな場所について話す。

I like manga cafes. Manga cafes are called 'manga kissa' in Japan. In Japan, we can read books, mainly manga. We can use personal computers in there.

Recently, I'm interested in reading manga because they inspire me to come up with new ideas and learn various concepts.

Science fiction manga is exciting to me.

Yeah, some manga describe how to solve issues and manage people and things when we face challenges. This has helped me a lot in working with various people and facing challenging issues at work.

Yes, Dr. Stone and Slam Dunk are particularly inspiring to me.

### 23. ショッピング
買い物の頻度や最近購入したものについて話す。

I usually go shopping twice a month.

They are made in England and they were so expensive.

Price is important to me because if something is too expensive, I can't buy it. So, the price is a crucial factor.

Secondly, usability is important. If you buy something that isn't useful, it's not a good purchase. If you want to make a good purchase, you should consider how useful the item is.

Size is also an important factor for me. If it is too big, it is hard to carry and fit it into my home. So, considering how big something is, is very important.

I consider the price and where we should buy it.

Actually, I don't have anything in particular. If you buy something online, you can't see it directly. On the other hand, if you buy at a local shop, you can see the item directly. It's very convenient.

I prefer buying from online shops rather than local shops because it is convenient and easy to buy something.

I usually buy things online when I don't need to check the size, fit, or texture. As I mentioned, I can't see items directly online, so I usually buy things that don't require checking.

### 24. ファッション
自分のファッションスタイルや好きなブランドについて話す。

I like casual and comfortable style because I usually train at a gym and running, so I always like sports brands such as Adidas, Nike, and so on.

Yes, I like the current sportswear because it's very casual, comfortable, and fits well.

### 25. 英語学習
英語学習の方法やモチベーションについて話す。

There are few opportunities to speak English with the other people, so I need the opportunity to speak English.

And second, when I talk with ChatGPT in English, I notice the phrases I struggle to come up with, and it makes it hard to express myself.

That's why I make a note of related things.

This is usually how I practice.

I'd like to improve my sentence structure, pronunciation, and how I express myself naturally in English.

As I mentioned, there are few opportunities to speak with people who speak English.

### 26. ソーシャルメディアの影響
ソーシャルメディアが生活に与える影響について話す。

Yeah, social media can distract us from concentrating.

For example, when I'm studying and get a notification, I check it and then stop studying, using my smartphone for a few minutes.

It's really bad for staying focused.

Yeah, I set limits on the usage of specific apps, like YouTube, Instagram, and Twitter.

I set a time limit for using these apps and try to reduce my usage.

Yes, but sometimes it doesn't work, especially when I'm on the train.

When I'm on the train, I'm free and don't have much to do, so I naturally want to check social media.

I end up spending a few hours on it, especially at night.

### 27. 仕事のストレス管理
I'd like to talk about methods for relieving stress and stress relaxation.
My method for relieving stress is training.
Going to gym and training makes me refresh.

Feeling a sense of growth toward your goal every day is the key to staying consistent.

### 28. 自分の故郷
The landmark tower is the second highest building in Japan.

### 29. 政治
I'd like to talk about politics.
Recently in Japan, there has been discussion about abolishing the income tax threshold limit, commonly referred to as the "1.03 million yen barrier."

I agree with this policy because it makes economics stimulate.

Removing the income limit might indeed encourage more people to work additional hours or take on better-paying jobs, which could lead to overall economic growth and increased household spending.

### 新機能リリース計画の社内プレゼン

Hi, everyone. Today, I would like to share our plan of release new features.
In preparing this plan, I focused on three key points.
Market, customer requests, product vision.

The market we operate in is shrinking because of the emergence of workspace-collaboration tools. While companies previously relied on all-in-one solutions like groupware, they now use a variety of tools and SaaS platforms to meet their needs.

In response to these market changes, our customers have been requesting features such as chat, collaborative writing, and industry-specific capabilities. This diversification makes developing work software increasingly complex.

Additionally, enterprise customers are asking for features that help them manage global operations and address their intricate workflows. To succeed in the enterprise market, we need to deeply understand and adapt to their systems.

We must also remain aligned with our product vision: “Connect all people.” Guided by this vision, we plan to introduce new features, including a messaging system, external collaboration permissions, design improvements, and more.

That concludes my overview of the new feature release plan. If you have any questions or feedback, please don’t hesitate to ask.

Thank you for your time and attention!

### 新機能デモとフィードバック収集
Hi, everyone. Today, I’d like to demo the new feature.
If you have any question or feedback, please share them with me.

First, I’ve implemented the CSV download feature. System administrators can now see how often and how much end-users access the product.
This helps them make better use of the data and take action if the usage score is low. This feature is designed to reduce churn.

If you have any feedback, I’d love to hear it.

Thank you for your time and attention.See you!
